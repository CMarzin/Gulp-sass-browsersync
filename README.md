# Gulp-sass-browsersync
A simple gulp file with a sass compilator, watchers and a localhost.
This is a very simple gulpfile, nice to beginning but if you want more plugin go to npm and enjoy the power of gulp !

Free to use in every project you make !


A little explanation if you don't know how to use nodejs and gulp.


First of all :
You need to install nodejs on your computer https://nodejs.org/en/
After that install gulp in global with this command on the terminal ( node.js command prompt for window)

npm install gulp

you have to take the path of your file, copy it then in the terminal 

cd C:\yourpathtoyourfile 

Now we have to download sass and browsersync but not in global like gulp, just in local.

npm install --save-dev gulp-sass
npm install --save-dev browser-sync

After the downloading you have just to write "gulp" in your terminal and TADA ! its works !
